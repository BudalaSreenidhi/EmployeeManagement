In this project, I worked on Spring Boot, and by using MVC architecture.
I created an employee management system where we can add, edit, and delete the details of the employee. 
By using the entity class to create tables in the database. 
In the repository, I wrote the access code to the database, like the username and password. In the controller class, I map the URLs to certain operations.
I perform operations by using annotations. 
And in service class, by using in-built methods like save, get, findall,. 
I used to perform certain crud operations in the database.Â 
You check out the code in the master branch.
